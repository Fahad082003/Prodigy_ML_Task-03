 Task 3 Completed! 🎉✨
🚀 Thrilled to share my progress on building a Cat vs Dog image classifier! 🐱🐶

Using classic machine learning techniques like HOG feature extraction combined with an SVM classifier, I achieved a promising 86.11% accuracy on my test dataset! 📊💻

🔍 Highlights:
Extracted meaningful HOG features to capture image textures and shapes 🖼️✨
Trained an SVM model that effectively differentiates cats from dogs 🎯🐾
Carefully balanced and preprocessed the dataset to improve model performance ⚖️🧹
Reached 86.11% test accuracy on a modest but diverse dataset 📈✅
